To access and utilize the script, open the "mitchell_final_project_script.R" filem which contains the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open the "LUKE COMBS DATA SET - Sheet(1).csv" file. 
This is my final project for Social Statistics where I analyzed music by Luke Combs. I looked at the energy level, main topics, song length, and tempo by bpm for each song to come to a conclusion. 

## **Data**
The data used for the analyes was collected by shuffling Luke Combs' discography and using arandom sample of numerous songs that played. I analyzed how the energy level compared to song length, tempo by bpm, and the main topic the song was about. Each unit of analysis was one song and 30 observations were collected. The type of sampling strategy was convenience sampling.

I gathered the data by first, shuffling his music on Spotify and recording the first 30 songs that played. To find the song length I would use the time spotify provided. Along with that to find the bpm I used a website on google that translated his songs into bpm. To find the main topics I analyzed the lyrics to come to a conclusion on what the song was about. Lastly, for energy level I listened to each song and recorded my thoughts on how the song made me feel and if I would be able to dance to each song or if it was more of a stand/swaying song. 

## **Operationalization**
The concept of the Energy Level was operationalized by using a qualitative coding scheme sacle from 1-5 named energy level. 1 would describe low energy, 2 would describe medium-low energy, 3 would describe medium energy, 4 would describe medium-high energy, and 5 would describe high energy. For this, I measured energy level by if I felt they were dance worthy songs where one would jump up and down or more of a sway and stand still type of song. 

The concept of Main Topics was operationalized through a qualitating coding scheme scale from 1-5 named main topics. 1 would describe songs about heartbreak, 2 would describe songs about love, 3 would describe songs about drinking, 4 would describe songs about growing up and 5 would describe songs under the name "other" which meant they didn't fit into the other previously stated categories. For this variable, the meaning and lyrics of the song were taken into consideration when operationalization. 

The concept of song length was operationalized through a quantitative variable named song length, where songs were measured by the amount of seconds each song lasted. Songs with shorter songs would fall lower an this scale and vice-versa. The song length was calculated by using Spotify to measure how long each song length was and was then converted from minutes to seconds.

The concept of the tempo measured in bpm was operationalized through a quanitative variable named tempo bpm, where songs were measured on a bpm scale of 0-240 bpm. A slower song would fall lower on this scale and vice-versa. To measure this concept, a website online was used to find the tempo in bpm for each song.
